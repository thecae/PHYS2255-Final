# Special Relativity Visualizer

> This project was completed as the final project for PHYS-2255 at Vanderbilt University.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate various special relativity concepts using 3D graphics. The project is written in Javascript using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library.  The project is hosted as a subdirectory of my primary website, [https://cole-ellis.com/physics](https://cole-ellis.com/physics).
